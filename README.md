I have uploaded a video of my game in the name of "FortyShadesOfGray_NormalMode"

Task 1 : Forty shades of gray (Normal-Mode)

Code which I did for my college club Induction:

Problem Statement:

Procoder Bharath needs to count the number of registrations for his college fest. He's too busy for something so trivial and so he asks his juniors for help. Help him determine the fastest candidate for the job. Build a website similar to this which would test a user's counting speed. Be creative!

Normal Mode:(Requirements)

Arrange layers of numbers randomly in a square grid and allow a user to count by tapping on the numbers in ascending order
Time the user and display their score in seconds
Store the 5 best times using LocalStorage and display them.
